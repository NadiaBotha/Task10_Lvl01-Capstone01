finance_calculators is a Python file which allows the user to run an investment calculator or a home loan repayment calculator.

## Functions
The user can select to run either an investment calculator or a home loan repayment calculator. 

If the user selects the investment calculator, the program requests the amount to deposit, interest rate, number of years investing, type of interest(compound or simple). The program then returns and displays the value of the investment based on the input provided. (Note that two different formulas are used to calculate compound and simple interest).

If the user selects the home loan repayment calculator, the program requests the value of the house, the interest rate and number of months to repay the bond. The monthly bond repayment is then calculated and displayed to the user.

## Use
The program is useful to banks and other financial providers to quickly calculate return on investments or monthly bond repayments. The program is easy to use and avoids the need to do manual calculations, which makes the whole process quicker, efficient and less prone to human error.
